## **About** üêü

**Welcome to Arowana Certification Platform by Team 18**

The **Asian Arowana** is one of the most expensive fish in the fishkeeping hobby. With prices ranging from a couple of hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. Traditionally, upon purchasing an Asian Arowana fish, a certificate is given to indicate the breed and authenticity of its origins by a renowned farm. 

The certificate is tied to a microchip that is tagged within Arowana's body. The issue arises when the said certificate is either lost or damaged; this brings the authenticity of the Arowana into question. 

The certificate takes large precedence in importance due to various factors it has an effect on. These include the cost of the Arowana (certificate-less Arowana tend to cost a lot lesser as compared to certified Arowana); the efficiency of transactions between hobbyists (certificate helps hobbyists verify if the fish that they are getting are actually authentic); importation and exportation of Arowana due to regulations and restrictions of countries (certifications aids with the process of importation and exportation, due to certain countries allowing only a specific species of Arowana to be imported/ exported); efficient verification of the legitimacy of the Arowana, comparing between ‚Äúpure‚Äù and high-quality Arowana from legitimate farms to the illegitimate Arowana that were being sold on the open market.

Arowana Open Cert aim to solve such issue by utilising blockchain technology through the medium Web3 and smart contracts (standard ERC 721), which eliminates the need for traditional paper certificates. 

This way, hobbyists would have peace of mind when purchasing and or selling, importing/ exporting, and breeding Asian Arowana fish as they are able to verify and authenticate what they are getting through the use of the digital certificate present on the blockchain. 

In addition, this helps eliminate the fear and hassle of losing their certificate, as it can always be easily retrieved through the blockchain. This can also help mitigate problems such as illegal smuggling and fraud in the industry.
